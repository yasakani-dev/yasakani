# Building yskn.dll from source

The release page has a prebuilt `yskn.dll`. You can also build it yourself. You do not need a GPU to build it, only to run it.
日本語：Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools（C++）、CUDA Toolkit、CMake、Ninja を入れ、「x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022」で下の 2 つのコマンドを実行します。

## What the release was built with (2026-11-07)

| | |
|---|---|
| OS | Windows 11, x64 |
| C++ compiler | Microsoft Visual C++ 19.44.35226 (Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools, toolset 14.44.35207) |
| CUDA | NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit 13.2 (nvcc 13.2.78) |
| Build tools | CMake (3.24 or newer is required) and Ninja |
| Target | compute capability 12.0 (`sm_120`), which the whole RTX 50 series shares. Tested on the RTX 5090 only |

The `yskn.dll` on the release page is this build (SHA-256 `0f5d973b791c8d66034d87bdfc7f2c018718dc0e851b9a6ee6dc1eb275150bbb`). It was built
from this source with the two commands below (the CUDA compiler was named explicitly with `-DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER`), and it is the build
the YASAKANI speed tables in [docs/MEASUREMENTS.md](docs/MEASUREMENTS.md) were measured with. Other compiler or CUDA versions have not been
tried. Compute capability 12.0 needs a recent CUDA Toolkit.

## Steps

Open the **x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022** (so that the compiler is on the path), go to the source folder (the one with
`CMakeLists.txt`) and run:

```bat
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

The result is `build\yskn.dll` (about 26 MB; the CUDA runtime is linked statically, so no CUDA Toolkit is needed to run it). The recorded build of
the release took about a minute and a half and printed many compiler warnings; they are known.

Pass the file to the tools with `--dll`:

```bat
yasakani info --model-dir D:\models\qwen38 --dll build\yskn.dll
```

`yasakani info` prints the SHA-256 of the DLL. A build made with a different compiler or CUDA version will not be byte-identical to the file on the
release page; that is expected. Check the model files with `yasakani verify`, and the whole installation with `yasakani selfcheck`.

## Layout

* `src/`: the engine (C++ and CUDA); `include/`: the C interface that the Python package binds to; `third_party/`: nlohmann/json (MIT).
* The Python package is built and installed separately (`pip install .` in its folder).
* The tool that converts a model into the YASAKANI file format is not part of this release.
